Hello my username is goalbasher. I am new to prgramming and I am trying to learn Python. I am interested in learning how to program games.
I am currently learning the basics of python. I retired as a lead computer technician supervisor. I never got into programming until now. I am a retired 66 year old man trying to learn a new skill.
